Reducing Road Risk in Montgomery County, Maryland
Data-Driven Crash Analysis and Road Risk Severity Index (RRSI)
Overview

This project analyzes driver and non-motorist crash data from Montgomery County, Maryland to identify the conditions that contribute to roadway incidents. Through examination of temporal trends, environmental factors, infrastructural conditions, and crash responsibility, the study finds that crashes result from the interaction of multiple factors rather than a single cause.

The project introduces the Road Risk Severity Index (RRSI), a weighted scoring framework that evaluates road segments based on crash frequency, injury severity, and time-of-day risk. The results provide evidence-based recommendations for safety improvements across the county.

Objectives

Analyze crash trends involving drivers and non-motorists.

Identify temporal, environmental, and infrastructural factors linked to crash likelihood.

Examine responsibility patterns in reported incidents.

Develop a Road Risk Severity Index (RRSI) to score road segments.

Recommend targeted safety interventions based on high-risk areas.

Methods

The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preparation

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Cross-factor and correlation assessment

Severity-based scoring model (RRSI)

Visualization of crash patterns and high-risk locations

Road Risk Severity Index (RRSI)

RRSI assigns a composite score to each road segment, incorporating:

Crash frequency

Injury severity

Time-of-day risk concentration

Pedestrian or non-motorist involvement

Higher scores indicate segments that should be prioritized for safety improvements.

Recommendations

Based on RRSI findings, the project recommends:

Increased enforcement during peak crash hours

Enhanced signage, lighting, and traffic control features

Improvements to pedestrian infrastructure

Safety-focused redesigns at high-risk intersections and corridors
